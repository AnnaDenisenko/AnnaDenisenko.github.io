              My name is [YOUR NAME]. I am a constituent residing at [YOUR ZIP CODE].<br><br>

              I am calling to express my deep concern regarding potential changes in U.S. policy that could lead to a reduction of military aid to Ukraine. <br><br>

              U.S. assistance is vital for Ukraine's ability to defend itself and its people against the ongoing Russian invasion. <br><br>

              A reduction in aid would significantly weaken Ukraine's defenses, leading to dire humanitarian consequences, further enabling Russia's aggression, which has already caused immense suffering and violated international law. <br><br>

              It is crucial that the United States continues to clearly and firmly oppose Russia's illegal invasion and support Ukraine's right to exist as a free and independent nation.  Consistent and robust support sends a powerful message to Ukraine, Russia, and to the world, about where the U.S. stands on these fundamental issues.<br><br>

              I urge Senator <span id="lastNamePlaceholder">[Last Name]</span> to strongly advocate for the continuation and strengthening of U.S. assistance to Ukraine.  It is an investment in peace, security, and the democratic values we share. <br><br>

              Thank you for your time and consideration of this urgent matter. I would greatly appreciate it if you would relay my message to Senator <span id="lastNamePlaceholder2">[Last Name]</span>.
